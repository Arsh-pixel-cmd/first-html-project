# 🌐 Mr. Code — My First HTML Project

This is my **first-ever multi-page website**, built entirely using **pure HTML** — no CSS or JavaScript. It helped me learn the core structure of web pages, navigation between them, form handling, multimedia embedding, and using tables.

- 🌱 **Built With:** HTML only
- 📄 **Pages:**

## 📣 Note

This project is intentionally **unstyled** and simple. It reflects the foundation of my web development journey, where I focused on understanding the **raw power of HTML** before moving on to CSS or JavaScript.
